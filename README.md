## required html and CSS:
    As we use react, we are allowed to not have the html files in the project spec as specified in the announcement oct 08.

    Hence we have:
    Search.js to substitute for search.html
    Result.js to substitute for result_sample.html
    Spot.js to substitute for individual_sample.html
    Submission.js to substitute for submission.html
    Registration.js to substiture for registration.html
